# GOV.UK AWS

This is the code that deploys GOV.UK in AWS.

## Getting started

Start by reading [the getting started guide](docs/guides/getting-started.md).

## Building a new environment

Please see [the environment provisioning guide](docs/guides/environment-provisioning.md) for building a fresh environment.

## govuk-tools account

The `govuk-tools` account does not behave like a normal environment. It contains one-off resources and does not need to be built like a normal environment.

## Architecture Decision Records

We're recording architecture decisions we make so we have a history and context on our implementation.

Please see the [ADR documentation](docs/architecture/README.md) for further details.
