/**
* ## Modules: aws/alarms/rds
*
* This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
* AWS/RDS namespace:
*
*   - CPUUtilization greater than or equal to threshold
*   - FreeableMemory less than threshold
*   - FreeStorageSpace less than threshold
*   - ReplicaLag greater than or equal to threshold
*
* All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated
* during 2 consecutive periods.
*
* For master instances, we should leave the ReplicaLag alarm disabled. To
* disable the ReplicaLag alarm, set the `replicalag_threshold`
* parameter to 0.
*
* AWS/RDS metrics reference:
*
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/rds-metricscollected.html
