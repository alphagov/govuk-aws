## Module: aws/alarms/elb

This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
AWS/ELB namespace:

  - HTTPCode\_Backend\_4XX greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode\_Backend\_5XX greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode\_ELB\_4XX greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode\_ELB\_5XX greater than or equal to threshold
  - SurgeQueueLength greater than or equal to threshold
  - HealthyHostCount less than threshold

All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated
during 5 consecutive periods.

HTTPCode\_* metrics are only reported for HTTP listeners. These metrics
should encapsulate errors caused by high SurgeQueueLength values and
lack of healthy backends.

For HTTP listeners we can disable SurgeQueueLength and HealthyHostCount
alarms. For TCP listeners, we should disable HTTPCode\_* alarms.

To disable HTTPCode\_* alarms, set the `httpcode_*_threshold` parameters to 0.
To disable the SurgeQueueLength alarm, set the `surgequeuelength_threshold`
parameter to 0.
To disable the HealthyHostCount alarm, set the `healthyhostcount_threshold`
parameter to 0.
