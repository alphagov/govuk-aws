/**
* ## Modules: aws/alarm/alb
*
* This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the
* AWS/ApplicationELB namespace:
*
*   - HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
*   - HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
*   - HTTPCode_ELB_4XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
*   - HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count greater than or equal to threshold
*
* All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated
* during 5 consecutive periods.
*
* To disable any alarm, set the threshold parameter to 0.
*
* AWS/ApplicationELB metrics reference:
*
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/elb-metricscollected.html#load-balancer-metric-dimensions-alb
