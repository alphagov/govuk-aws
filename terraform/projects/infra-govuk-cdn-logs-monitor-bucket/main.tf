/**
* ## Project: infra-govuk-cdn-logs-monitor-bucket
*
* Stores data that is being archived due to the retirement of
* [govuk-cdn-logs-monitor](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-cdn-logs-monitor).
* The intention is for this to be temporary and data won't be added to this
* after archiving. So if you're reading this in June 2019 this is pretty safe
* to delete.
