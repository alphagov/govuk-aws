/**
* ## Project: accounts-pre-digital-identity-backups-bucket
*
* This bucket has been creating for storing databases that were used on the
* GOV.UK accounts prototype. This service has now been superseded by DI.
* We however made a commitment to storing our backups for 2 years and it
* contains data (the audit log in the security_activities table) which wasn't
* migrated to digital identity.
*
* The likelihood of us actually needing these files is low, and once we reach
* November 3rd 2023 they will be removed (we can then remove this bucket).
